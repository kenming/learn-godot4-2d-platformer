# Castle Climbers Game Development with Godot 4 and C\#

This is a hands-on practice to learn how to develop games using Godot 4.

Study book: "[Learn Godot 2D Platformer](https://oops-i-devd.gitbook.io/christinedevs/godot-tutorials/castle-climbers-platformer)" PDF format.

## Rewrite in C\#

The sample code in the book is written in GDScript language, and I rewrote all the sample code directly in C#.NET during the hands-on exercise.

At the end of each chapter, the project source will be Git tagged and synchronized to the GitHub repository!

I highly recommend this ebook as a great introduction to Godot game development for beginners.
